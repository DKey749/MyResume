I am a PhD candidate in Organic Chemistry with a diverse range of
academic and industry experience. During my PhD, I successfully balanced
my research with managing two significant multiyear projects. I co-founded
an educational platform with thousands of students and managed
development of a mathematical board game that is now distributed
worldwide. My internship at a biotech company in Iceland during my
master's studies involved managing large-scale optimization of chitosane
synthesis and gaining insights into financial management. With my PhD
finishing in September, I am seeking a stable position in a renowned
company where I can utilize both my chemistry knowledge and
communication skills to drive mutual success and prosperity.
