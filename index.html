    <h1>Daniel Kortus</h1>
    <img src="./assets/images/photo.JPG" height="200">

    <p>I am a PhD candidate in Organic Chemistry with a diverse range of
    academic and industry experience. During my PhD, I successfully balanced
    my research with managing two significant multiyear projects. I co-founded
    an educational platform with thousands of students and managed
    development of a mathematical board game that is now distributed
    worldwide. My internship at a biotech company in Iceland during my
    master's studies involved managing large-scale optimization of chitosane
    synthesis and gaining insights into financial management. With my PhD
    finishing in September, I am seeking a stable position in a renowned
    company where I can utilize both my chemistry knowledge and
    communication skills to drive mutual success and prosperity.</p>
